# Recent Seismic Activity in Greece

A Shiny application displaying recent earthquakes in Greece, using data from

the [Seismological Laboratory of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](<http://dggsl.geol.uoa.gr/en_index.html>).

The most recent earthquake is displayed with a red pulsating marker. All other

earthquakes are colored according to how recent they are. When the user clicks

an entry from the earthquakes table, the entry is highlighted with a white

marker on the map.
